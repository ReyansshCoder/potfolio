Hi

 <br>
I am Shubh Narain

<br> 
a Student of Seth M.R Jaipuria <br>
Studying in Class 7<sup>th</sup> <br>
And today, I present to you 'All-most about me' <br>
In this I will be taking you to a trip, <br> where you will come to know a lot about me. 



<br> So lets start by seeing a young photo of mine  </h3> <hr>
<img src="C:\Users\LENOVO\Downloads\unknown (8).png"> <p align="left"> First of all, I would like to tell you that I made a whole website <br>

Now I would Like to tell you my hobbies using a list <br> <br> <hr> <center> 

<list> <marquee> <b> <u> My Hobbies </marquee></u> </b> <b> <ol> Music </ol> </b>
I really love music. Its Either singing songs or listening to songs or playing any instrument. I just love it </ul>
<b> <ol> Art </ol> </b>
I like to do artwork, sometimes drawing, painting or some sort of creative craft work. And I would claim that I am pretty good at that 
<b> <ol> BasketBall </ol> </b>
I would rather not call it something as a hobby, but I have been playing basketball since 3 months by now, and I really love it.
<b> <ol> Video Games/Games </ol> </b>
This includes several video games and board games. I am addicted to video games, its like when I start playing, I really have fun and it becoms a bit hard to leave. I love playing board games with my cousins as well, these things are too fun.
<b> <ol> Net/Social media surfing </ol> </b> So this is something very fun to time pass with. I love to surf through YouTube looking for different and interesting videos. The same applies for the Internet.
  </center> 
<b> So I guess this is all about my hobbies. 
<br> Thankyou for checking this out.
